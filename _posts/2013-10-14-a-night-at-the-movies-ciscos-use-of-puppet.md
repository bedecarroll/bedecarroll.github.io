I seem to be on a bit of a Puppet kick as of late. Of a night I&#8217;ve been watching the many awesome videos of the 2013 PuppetConf and I found this one quite interesting. To me this pattern shows the future of deploying vendor supplied applications and I&#8217;m sure all sysadmins will be eternally grateful.

I just wish the presentation had been allowed to finish. <img src="http://www.bedecarroll.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />
