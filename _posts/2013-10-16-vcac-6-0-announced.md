For those that are unaware, VMworld Barcelona is currently going on and with it brings new product updates. In my quest for automation knowledge I&#8217;ve become quite interested in vCAC. The unfortunate downside is that (like all &#8220;automation&#8221; systems, I&#8217;m sure) it is quite involved in setting it up. With that in mind I&#8217;ve only spent a little bit of time trying to get it going but I&#8217;ve learnt one thing, it sure isn&#8217;t a next, next, next install! If you want to give it a crack I would recommend looking at <a href="http://www.jonathanmedd.net/2013/09/automating-the-pre-requisites-for-vcac-5-2.html" target="_blank">this blog post by Jonathan Medd</a> as he has written a PowerShell script to at least automate the prerequisites.

Anyway! Back to the vCAC 6.0. The Elastic Skies blog has a <a href="http://elasticskies.com/vcac-6-0-announced/" target="_blank">good run down on what is new</a>. Not mentioned but very important (IMHO) is integration with Puppet (<a href="https://puppetlabs.com/about/press-releases/puppet-labs-announces-enhanced-integration-vmware-vcloud-automation-center-6" target="_blank">as per the press release</a>). A vCAC install will be able to log in, read and understand your Puppet manifests. From what I can tell the vCAC server will act as an ENC (External Node Classifier) allowing you to use Puppet to define a standard way nodes are to be configured and then have vCAC deploy and classify the VMs as to which role they should be.

To me this seems like a powerful way to &#8220;close the loop&#8221;, in a manner of speaking, from graphical drag and drop creation of services to allow user to request through to not only configuring a VM based on a definition but toÂ *enforce* the definition. As someone with lots of &#8220;stuff&#8221; I find the idea of forcing the systems to conform even more powerful than building things in an automated way.

Interesting times!
