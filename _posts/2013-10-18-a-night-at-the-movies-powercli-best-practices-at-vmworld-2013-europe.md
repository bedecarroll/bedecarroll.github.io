For the past few years at VMworld, rockstar PowerShell gurus Alan Renouf and Luc Dekens have given a presentation on PowerCLI. Before I&#8217;ve felt that they could go a bit deeper and in this presentation I think they have hit it right on the mark with the depth. Some pretty good tips makes this worth watching.

WARNING: This isn&#8217;t an intro to PowerCLI, if you don&#8217;t know what an object is or you are just starting out then this might be a bit overwhelming. I&#8217;m not sure why they ask people to leave if they are looking for an intro, if you&#8217;ve read a PowerShell script you can get a vague idea about what they are going on about. I&#8217;m a believer in immersing yourself so you might not understand but when you do get to that level you can think back and go, &#8220;ah, that is what they were on about!&#8221;. But that is just my learning style.
