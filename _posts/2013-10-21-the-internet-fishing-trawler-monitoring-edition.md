*   At VMworld 2013 vCOps 5.8 was announced. There seem to be some pretty cool features in there. Eric Shanks at The IT Hollow has <a href="http://theithollow.com/2013/10/vmware-vcops-5-8-announced/" target="_blank">a great break down on the new features</a>.

&nbsp;

*   By default you can&#8217;t really get data out of vCOps but there is a <a href="http://velemental.com/2012/09/04/unofficial-vmware-vcenter-operations-powershell-module/" target="_blank">community PowerShell module</a> to allow you to get the stats out. <a href="http://enterpriseadmins.org/blog/scripting/getting-data-out-of-vcops/" target="_blank">Brian Wuchner over at EnterpriseAdmins.org shows how to use it</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Moving into the world of SCOM, 2012 R2 the venerable SCOM Agent is being renamed Microsoft Monitoring Agent. There are a couple of new features in the new agent but nothing earth shattering, to me. Marnix Wolf <a href="http://thoughtsonopsmgr.blogspot.nl/2013/09/scom-2012-r2-hello-mma-microsoft.html" target="_blank">has the breakdown and a great side by side comparison chart</a>.

&nbsp;

*   If you are doing an upgrade to 2012 R2 there are a few things you need to be aware of and Marnix again <a href="http://thoughtsonopsmgr.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/scom-2012-r2-scom-2012-sp1-scom-2012.html" target="_blank">has all the answers</a>. What surprised me is the compatibility between the different agent versions.

&nbsp;

*   The Cisco Security blog has a post on <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/security/making-boring-logs-interesting/" target="_blank">a topic everyone loves, logs</a>! The title is &#8220;Making Boring Logs Interesting&#8221;, I&#8217;m sure they mean interesting as in useful and not to make it an interesting read. Maybe&#8230;
