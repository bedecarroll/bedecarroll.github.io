*   It seems <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Kaspersky+flags+TCPIPSYS+as+Malware/16904" target="_blank">Kaspersky Anti-Virus is identifying tcpip.sys as malware</a>. How can this be happening in 2013? This issue has been going on since AV was introduced and yet there has been no movement. Very sad.

&nbsp;

*   Every time an AV issue like this one crops up <a href="http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2012/04/09/is-anti-virus-really-dead-a-real-world-simulation-created-for-forensic-data-yields-surprising-results" target="_blank">I feel the need to post this article by the SANS Computer Forensics blog</a>. I feel that at this point AV simply checks a box and provides noÂ *real* protection against anything but the lowest and most common threats.

*   In more interesting news, the myvirtualcloud.net blog has <a href="http://myvirtualcloud.net/?p=5522" target="_blank">an interesting post on a VDI solution out in the sticks and the educational outcomes they helped provide</a>. I&#8217;m still a little fuzzy on how the tech was setup but I can only assume it was a local VDI solution and not over their tiny 2Mb/s VSAT.

*   Stephen Foskett has <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2013/10/23/vmware-integrated-caching-fast/" target="_blank">a great blog post on the issues and technical challenges surrounding host-based flash acceleration</a>. These kinds of flash enhancements are all the rage at the moment and it will be interesting to see who survives and what model of flash integration the industry ultimately settles on.

&nbsp;

*   In jaw dropping news, python sweetness has <a href="http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/64740079543/how-to-lose-172-222-a-second-for-45-minutes" target="_blank">a great overview of the SEC report into the failure of Knight Capital</a>. If you were watching the financial industry back in August 2012 you would remember the explosion of Knight Capital, you could see it unfolding right in front of your eyes. It is hard to believe an organisation with that much capital and with such a reliance on IT had such poor internal practices. This is well worth the read to hopefully learn from their painful mistake.
