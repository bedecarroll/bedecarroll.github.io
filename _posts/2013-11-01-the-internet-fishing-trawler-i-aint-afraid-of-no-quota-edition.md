*   Seems there is a bit of a change in the way mailbox sizes are calculated in Exchange 2013. You can read <a href="http://windowsitpro.com/blog/increase-exchange-2013-mailbox-sizes-simply-store-tax" target="_blank">a good argument on why it isn&#8217;t a big issue from Tony at Windows IT Pro</a>. To me it is only a non-issue if the numbers in Outlook match up. If users find they&#8217;ve suddenly lost quota they tend to get pretty annoyed!

*   Having upgraded to Windows 8.1 it is very clear Microsoft want you to have a Microsoft Account. This isn&#8217;t that bad and can provide some nice features however they seem to be doing this at the expense of corporate identities. The true power Microsoft are trying to gain is over your data. In light of this the SBS Diva Blog (R.I.P SBS) has a post on <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/bradley/archive/2013/10/26/the-push-for-microsoft-accounts.aspx" target="_blank">how to disable the Microsoft account using GPO</a>.

*   This is a bit of an old link as I don&#8217;t use vSphere Replication but <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/10/vr-5-5-performance.html" target="_blank">VMware have made some important improvements in 5.5 that make for an interesting read</a>. Some of the performance improvements are pretty awesome and really drive home the point that you really need to understand TCP when you work with it.

*   In Windows 8 a new feature was added called File History. Think of it as Time Machine but for Windows. <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn448546.aspx" target="_blank">TechNet Magazine have an article that provides a quick run down on what it is and how it works</a>.

*   <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Greenbone+and+OpenVAS+Scanner/16874" target="_blank">Richard Porter over at the SANS ISC has created a cool VM for Greenbone which integrates with OpenVAS</a>. For those that don&#8217;t know, OpenVAS is an open source vulnerability scanner, a fork from when Nessus was also open source. Greenbone have a whole suite of stuff to help with vulnerability assessment but it can also work with OpenVAS to schedule scans.
