*   <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2013/10/31/automatic-system-lock-feature.aspx" target="_blank">New versions of the Dell iDRAC have a feature to auto-lock the OS when the last virtual console has disconnected</a>. I think this is pretty useful and I&#8217;d like something like this inside VMware but it is obviously more important for physical servers.

*   John Allspaw at the Kitchen Soap blog <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/" target="_blank">has a really great post on being a senior engineer</a>. This is one of those articles that I think everyone should read. I hope to live up to what is described in that post.

*   Still at the Kitchen Soap blog, <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2013/10/29/counterfactuals-knight-capital/" target="_blank">John has a great post on the Knight Capital case</a> that I&#8217;ve posted about before. This is one of those posts where you&#8217;re going to want to get a little quiet time to read.

*   James D. Brown has an interesting piece at <a href="http://www.wired.com/insights/2013/10/mythbusting-devops-and-security/" target="_blank">Wired on the role of security in the new DevOps paradigm</a>. I&#8217;m a firm believer in DevOps as I think it helps get IT where it needs to be, as a fast and powerful business enabler.

*   It appears that the Microsoft policy on disk duplication has been updated as <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314828" target="_blank">this KB has popped up in my RSS feeds</a>. Not sure what has changed (I think they&#8217;ve just updated the Applies To section for the new Windows versions) but I&#8217;m sure some will find this a handy link that they will need to refer to.
