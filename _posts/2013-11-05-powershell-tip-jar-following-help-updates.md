When PowerShell 3.0 was released one of the little &#8220;surprises&#8221; was that the help included in the download was a short stub. If you wanted the full help available in your PowerShell session then you need to use the cmdletÂ *Update-Help*. While i&#8217;ve now gotten over the shock (I&#8217;ve adapted to just using Google) it is still important to find out what is changing in the documentation.

With that in mind I suggest you pop on down to <a href="http://richardspowershellblog.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/powershell-help-rss-feed/" target="_blank">Richard Siddaway&#8217;s blog and use the link provided to put into your RSS reader of choice</a>. It never hurts to keep an eye on what they are up to over at MSHQ.
