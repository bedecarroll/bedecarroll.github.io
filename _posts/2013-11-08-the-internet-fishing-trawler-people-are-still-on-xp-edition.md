*   Hard to believe it but yes, people are still using Windows XP (it is pretty popular in industrial applications). The SANS ISC has <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/SIR+v15%3A+Five+good+reasons+to+leave+Windows+XP+behind/16922" target="_blank">a good post on why you should move away</a> and some metrics on the Swiss cheese security of the OS.

*   Sometimes I think Brian Madden lives in the cloud but his <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/brianmadden/archive/2013/11/05/if-you-have-file-storage-quotas-of-any-size-congratulations-your-data-is-in-the-public-cloud.aspx" target="_blank">post on the use of storage quotas in modern enterprises</a> really got me thinking about how end user perceptions of IT services really have changed. Forward looking IT services should provide not only the documented requirements but to the user perception of how IT should work, to me anyway.

*   Any network engineer worth their salt should be able to tell you of the mice and elephants issue (thought they may know it by a different name). Over at the Network Heresy blog there is <a href="http://networkheresy.com/2013/11/01/of-mice-and-elephants/" target="_blank">a great post that gives you a primer on the issue and some potential workarounds</a>. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see the Open vSwitch based solutions in action. Helping to solve/alleviate issues like these is really where the power of SDN lies.

&nbsp;

*   F5 are launching their SD* (at this point should we just drop the whole SD prefix?) strategy to push the whole &#8220;Software Defined&#8221; up the stack to layer 7. <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/news/f5-takes-last-step-virtual-reality/2013/11/" target="_blank">SDNCentral have the details on their announcement</a>. I&#8217;ll be interested to read about it when/if it gets released.

&nbsp;

*   Groupon have <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/misc/i-tier-dismantling-the-monoliths/" target="_blank">a really interesting post on the rewrite of their core web application</a>. I have to admit I always find these software architecture posts interesting, I&#8217;ve written a few little apps in my time but the idea of scaling things to the size that these companies require is always impressive.
