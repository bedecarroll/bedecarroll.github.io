*   Cisco have announced their Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) initiative. Over at the Cisco Data Center and Cloud blog they have <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/is-your-data-center-ready-for-aci-transformation/" target="_blank">a post that details where it fits into their overall strategy</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Still at the Data Center and Cloud blog there is <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/application-centric-infrastructure-aci-includes-strong-partner-ecosystem-for-security-and-network-services/" target="_blank">another post that details some of the partners that Cisco have lined up for ACI</a>. I&#8217;m guessing these are all companies that don&#8217;t compete with Cisco directly (e.g. now that ACE is dead f5 are free to partner).

&nbsp;

*   Speaking of f5, as part of ACI they&#8217;ve announced support or compatibility between it and the f5 Synthesis &#8220;SDAS&#8221; architecture. Thankfully there is some kind of &#8220;detail&#8221; in the form of <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns517/ns224/ns945/solution-brief-c22-730004.html" target="_blank">a solution overview</a>. I really want to start seeing more technical detail though, but I have a feeling this is all way to new and it just doesn&#8217;t exist.

&nbsp;

*   For a bit of outside perspective, SDN Central have been covering the announcement and have an article, &#8220;<a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/news/is-cisco-sdn-architecture-really-that-special/2013/11/" target="_blank">Is Cisco&#8217;s SND Architecture Really That Special?</a>&#8220;. It is always good to hear outside the echo chamber.

&nbsp;

*   Thankfully SDN Central again rides to the rescue with <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/news/insieme-revealed-last-policy-fabric-course-new-switches/2013/11/" target="_blank">some more background and detail on Insieme/Nexus 9k</a>. This looks to be another one of those attempts by Cisco to short-circuit their seemingly bizarre internal politics where each BU have their knives out for the competition and each other. I wonder how many more of these spin-ins Cisco can really do before customers start questioning all the new non-compatible architectures that each one brings.
