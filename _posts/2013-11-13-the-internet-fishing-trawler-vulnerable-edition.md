*   Ah management devices, the soft underbelly of your infrastructure. The good people over at Rapid7 have been <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/community/metasploit/blog/2013/11/05/supermicro-ipmi-firmware-vulnerabilities" target="_blank">doing some analysis of the IPMI implementation in SuperMicro servers and have found a few things</a>. There will be some Metasploit modules released. While SuperMicro is the target here, if you watch your favourite hardware vendor&#8217;s announcements you will see this is something they all struggle with.

&nbsp;

*   There is a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2896666" target="_blank">Microsoft Graphics Component vulnerability doing the rounds as of late</a>. While it affects older software and versions of Windows, Lync 2010 and 2013 versions are affected on the client side.

&nbsp;

*   It feels like forever that we&#8217;ve been at the 4TB HDD level but <a href="http://architecting.it/2013/11/06/6tb-hgst-helium-drive-continues-move-to-two-tier-storage/" target="_blank">HGST have announced a 6TB hard drive</a>. I bet this will be hellishly expensive (it is airtight and using helium due to the lower density) so I doubt we will be filling up our NASes with these any time soon.

&nbsp;

*   Martijn over at Lost Domain is startingÂ <a href="http://lostdomain.org/2013/10/20/vmware-nsx-general/" target="_blank">a series of blog posts on VMware NSX</a>. I found this very useful as it gives an overview of each component. There is a lot to this SDN stuff and it varies between vendors so it can be a little hard keeping track.

&nbsp;

*   Yet <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/close-peek-at-cisco-aci/" target="_blank">more information on Cisco ACI is coming out</a>. One thing is for sure in all of this, learn VXLAN. Wither NVGRE I guess?
