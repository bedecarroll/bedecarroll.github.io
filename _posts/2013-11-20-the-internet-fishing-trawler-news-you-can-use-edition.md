*   For all you Microsoft admins out there, Redmond has release <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2013/11/08/free-ebook-introducing-windows-server-2012-r2-technical-overview.aspx" target="_blank">a free ebook on Windows Server 2012 R2</a>. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to look at it yet but it is free!

*   Citrix have announced their EOL dates for the Citrix Web Interface products. Get the dates and a Doctor Evil picture over <a href="http://www.vmwareinfo.com/2013/11/citrix-web-interface-end-of-life-dates.html" target="_blank">at the vCloudinfo blog</a>.

*   William Lam over at virtuallyGhetto has another great blog post on <a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2013/11/how-to-run-nested-esxi-on-top-of-vsan.html" target="_blank">getting nested ESXi (vInception) running on top of the new VSAN</a>. Because VSAN doesn&#8217;t use SCSI-2 reservations, ESXi wasn&#8217;t to happy about installing. I wonder if there are any other OSes where this could be an issue?

*   <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2052334" target="_blank">VMware KB 2052334 &#8211; &#8220;Installing vCenter Server 5.5 best practices&#8221; &#8211; is a KB you are going to want to put in your notes</a>.

&nbsp;

*   And the best for last. It seems HP has joined us in the future by releasing a PowerShell module for iLOs. I think it is about time and look forward to the module improving going forward. Kyle Ruddy over at &#8220;That&#8230; Could Be A Problem&#8230;&#8221; has <a href="http://thatcouldbeaproblem.com/?p=685" target="_blank">a great post with examples and all on how to use the new module</a>, well worth the read.
