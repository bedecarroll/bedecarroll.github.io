*   So the day has finally arrived where EMC have released the XtremeIO storage array. Josh Nash has <a href="http://jasonnash.com/2013/11/14/emc-finally-releases-the-xtremio-all-flash-array/" target="_blank">a great blog post on what makes up an XtremeIO system</a>. If you only read one post I&#8217;d recommend this one to get you up to speed on the XtremeIO.

&nbsp;

*   But it wasn&#8217;t all sunshine and unicorns for EMC, as <a href="http://architecting.it/2013/11/19/xtremio-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">this blog post over at ArchitectingIT will attest</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Robin Harris at StorageMojo has <a href="http://storagemojo.com/2013/11/08/xtremly-late-xtremio-launch-next-week/" target="_blank">his own take on the launch</a>. I find posts on the business options that these products represent to be interesting, it is a bit of a dynamic time in storage!

&nbsp;

*   The StorageIOBlog has a <a href="http://storageioblog.com/emc-announces-xtremio-general-availability-part/" target="_blank">two </a><a href="http://storageioblog.com/part-ii-emc-announces-xtremio-general-availability/" target="_blank">part </a>series on the XtremeIO with their own take.

&nbsp;

*   And last but not least, Itzik has <a href="http://itzikr.wordpress.com/2013/11/14/emc-xtremio-the-story-behind-the-story/" target="_blank">a post on the launch with videos and all</a>! Plus there is a bit on the differences/benefits of the XtremeIO. I&#8217;ll be interested to see the penetration of the product in the market going forward, the publicity generated by an XtremeIO being used for the VMware Hands-On-Labs sure doesn&#8217;t hurt (although EMC part owns VMware&#8230;).
