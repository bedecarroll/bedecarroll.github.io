*   How are those Windows XP migration projects coming along? Well I hope! A new 0-day is out for XP and it hits you right in the kernel. SANS has <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft+Security+Advisory+%282914486%29%3A+Vulnerability+in+Microsoft+Windows+Kernel+0+day+exploit+in+wild/17117" target="_blank">all the links and details for this one</a>.

*   If you use SCOM 2012 R2 and Dell devices there is a new management pack out now. You will want to <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2013/11/27/dell-management-packs-now-support-microsoft-system-center-2012-r2.aspx" target="_blank">head on over to the Dell TechCenter to see all the little goodies</a>.

*   I tend to rebuild my lab vCenter pretty often and now that I use the Nexus 1000v I think these awesome notes from Vallard at Vallard&#8217;s Tech Notes on <a href="http://benincosa.com/blog/?p=808" target="_blank">how to reconnect to an orphaned n1kv will come in handy</a>. Definitely one to keep around.

*   If you manage/work with BGP you should be aware of the issues around prefix hijacking. The is heading towards RPKI and Cisco has worked with a large portion of the prefix owners in Ecuador to deploy RPKI and have <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/perspectives/securing-critical-internet-infrastructure-a-rpki-case-study-in-ecuador/" target="_blank">a blog post on the event</a>. Very interesting and I hope this jumpstarts RPKI adoption.

*   Over at ComputerWorld there is <a href="http://news.idg.no/cw/art.cfm?id=D21968B0-EE1C-1249-85D672B34C0DA5BB" target="_blank">an article on some of the various configuration management tools available</a>. It seems pretty good and tries to be fair to all the vendors. Obviously when it comes time to make a choice you will need to perform your own testing to see what fits your environment but articles like these help. It sure seems like these configuration management tools are proliferating.
