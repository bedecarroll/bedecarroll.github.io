*   For those using Nested ESXi, Andreas Peetz over at VMware Front Experience <a href="http://www.v-front.de/2013/11/vmware-tools-for-nested-esxi-and-how-to.html" target="_blank">shows how you can use his great tool to turn the ESXi VMware Tools into a package suitable to put inside the installer</a>. I&#8217;ve requested that they consider releasing the VIB as a bundle to make it even easier.

*   Jonathan Medd has a blog post with his <a href="http://www.jonathanmedd.net/2013/11/creating-a-puppet-module-folder-structure-with-new-puppetmodule.html" target="_blank">Puppet module &#8220;skeleton&#8221; creator using PowerShell</a>. Even if you aren&#8217;t interested in Puppet you might enjoy reading some PowerShell.

*   Over at DailyTech they have <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Coalition+of+20+Tech+Firms+Backs+MRAM+as+Potential+DRAM+NAND+Replacement/article33826.htm" target="_blank">a great article on MRAM and various memory architectures and the current industry state of play</a>. Well worth the read and I think it will be an interesting time for hardware in the next few years.

*   More general IT news, unfortunately <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/7549/ocz-files-for-bancrupty-toshiba-offers-to-buy-the-assets" target="_blank">OCZ has gone bankrupt</a>. They were one of the pioneers of consumer SSDs so it will be a bit sad to seem them go even if their drives of late were of questionable reliability.

&nbsp;

*   Over at Technodrone there is a<a href="http://technodrone.blogspot.com/2013/11/installing-razor-yes-new-version.html" target="_blank">n awesome series on how to use the Puppet Razor module</a>. This is something I&#8217;d love to get a chance to try out in my lab when I get a chance.
