*   Brian Madden has <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/brianmadden/archive/2013/12/03/as-more-apps-move-off-windows-a-quot-well-managed-quot-desktop-is-worth-less-and-less.aspx" target="_blank">a great post on Windows desktop management</a>. I&#8217;d argue that the utility of &#8220;curating&#8221; a Windows environment is no where near what it once was. Do we really care that all users have the same background or that the notification area shows all icons? I doubt it. Perhaps we need to quantify the cost of all these configuration elements? Now that would be interesting!

*   The VMware PowerCLI blog has <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vipowershell/2013/12/using-tags-with-powercli.html" target="_blank">a good post on how to use the tagging feature with PowerCLI</a>.Â Unfortunately the glaring omission is the ability to create new tags with PowerCLI, word is it is being worked on though.

*   Dell have <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/dell-blogs/dell4enterprise/b/dell4enterprise/archive/2013/12/04/dell-and-puppet-labs-helping-customers-manage-their-heterogeneous-environments.aspx" target="_blank">announced they are working on integrating Puppet into &#8220;Active System Manager&#8221;</a>. I don&#8217;t really know to much about ASM but it appears to be their infrastructure manager. I&#8217;ll be interested to see the benefits of the integration.
