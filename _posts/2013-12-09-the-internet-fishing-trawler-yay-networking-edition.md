*   Over at Network Janitor, Kurt Bales has <a href="http://www.network-janitor.net/2013/11/on-python-networks-and-the-py-junos-eznc-library/" target="_blank">a fantastic blog post on the &#8220;py-junos-eznc&#8221; Python library</a>. It uses NETCONF for communication. Not everything out there uses REST APIs it seems&#8230;

&nbsp;

*   Speaking of programming, <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/cisco-nexus-9000-community-on-github/" target="_blank">Cisco have announced their GitHub repo for the new Nexus 9k series</a>. Well worth the look and I look forward to seeing it build out over time.

&nbsp;

*   Still at Cisco, the &#8220;Data Center and Cloud&#8221; blog has <a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/automated-fabric-provisioning-using-cisco-prime-dcnm/" target="_blank">a post on Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM)</a>. Could be interesting.

&nbsp;

*   Over at the Cisco Security blog there is an interesting post on &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.cisco.com/security/operational-security-intelligence/" target="_blank">Operational Security Intelligence</a>&#8220;. There is a veritable gold mine of information in your logs, think about DNS queries alone!

&nbsp;

*   Over at LoveMyTool there is <a href="http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2013/11/a-visual-mental-model-of-your-cisco-network-topology-byjohn-smith.html" target="_blank">a post on ActionPacked Networks&#8217; LiveAction tool</a>.Â I&#8217;ve never used it but I&#8217;ve seen it at places like Cisco Live! and it looks like it could be quite handy in large networks.
