*   <a href="http://bladesmadesimple.com/2013/12/idc-reports-worldwide-server-market-revenues-declines-3-7-q3-2013/" target="_blank">It seems that the blade server market grew at a nice clip in Q3 according to IDC</a> as reported by Kevin Houston at Blades Made Simple. I wonder how long this will continue? With VSAN and associated technologies, blades don&#8217;t really make sense to me. Maybe they won&#8217;t be as big a deal as they are made out to be?

*   I&#8217;ve been working a lot with Microsoft Word lately and quite frankly I hate it. I&#8217;m not sure how but I managed to stumble upon <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html" target="_blank">this blog post by Charlie Stross giving a good history lesson on Office and detailing the pain it has inflicted</a>. Due to recently working with GitHub md files, I&#8217;m thinking one of the Markdown flavours would be easier to use.

*   I&#8217;ve talked about the HP iLO PowerShell cmdlets before but <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/11/12/hp-scripting-tools-for-windows-powershell/" target="_blank">PowerShell Magazine has a good article with an overview of the module</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Still at PowerShell Magazine, they have <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/10/28/pstip-compress-and-uncompress-files-and-folders-using-wmi/" target="_blank">a good tip on how to use PowerShell to compress files using NTFS</a>. I&#8217;m a bit surprised you have to use WMI but I&#8217;m guessing the feature is infrequently used.

&nbsp;

*   Joel Reed at Start-Transcript has <a href="http://blog.start-transcript.com/2013/08/15/just-a-bunch-of-text-files/" target="_blank">a great PowerShell tip on how to use ConvertFrom-StringData to read in &#8220;ini&#8221; like configuration files</a>. I could see this coming in handy if you want to give your PowerShell script an &#8220;application-like&#8221; experience. Perhaps it might be useful in combination with scheduled tasks?
