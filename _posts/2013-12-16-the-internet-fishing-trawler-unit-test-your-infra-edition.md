*   In a pure example of the power of software-defined-whatever, over at Mauveweb there is <a href="http://mauveweb.co.uk/posts/2013/12/load-balancer-testing-with-honeyd.html" target="_blank">a great blog post on unit testing load balancer configurations with Honeyd</a>. Fantastic idea!

*   A great post by AirBnB on <a href="http://nerds.airbnb.com/smartstack-service-discovery-cloud/" target="_blank">their &#8220;SmartStack&#8221; service discovery software they have written to support their Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)</a>. I really like these posts as they give a great insight into how other people are designing their systems.

*   Alan Renouf over at Virtu-Al has a blog series called &#8220;<a href="http://www.virtu-al.net/2013/12/13/automation-tip-3its-people/" target="_blank">Top 10 Automation Tips</a>&#8220;. I&#8217;ve linked to tip three, &#8220;It&#8217;s all about people&#8221;, because it really is all about the people. I think this is especially true if you work in a normal organisation and not one of those young start-ups or cloud providers. The requirements for successful automation go well beyond just the technical.

*   Bob Plankers, The Lone Sysadmin, has a great idea, <a href="http://lonesysadmin.net/2013/12/12/collect-system-performance-data-guest-oses/" target="_blank">do not collect system performance data from guest OSes</a>. I can hear a lot of gasps from the monitoring crowd but think about it for a second, what do you need to know? How is the VM performing in relation to other virtual machines and the physical hardware? Is the service provided by the VM working? Those really are the questions you need to ask. Now I think I need the qualify this, this really applies to the guest operating system, all those super fancy application metrics will no doubt need an agent.

*   SDNCentral has an article on an idea which I&#8217;m assuming would have been floating around for awhile now, <a href="http://www.sdncentral.com/sdn-blog/nvgre-merge-vxlan/2013/12/" target="_blank">merge NVGRE and VXLAN</a>. By the looks of things the battle was fought and NVGRE lost.
