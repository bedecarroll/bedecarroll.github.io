*   I&#8217;m very happy to see that vCAC 6.0 is out and it looks much nicer to install now, being a vApp and all. I&#8217;d recommend have a read of the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/vcac/doc/vcloud-automation-center-60-release-notes.html" target="_blank">release notes on the VMware website</a>. When I get a chance I hope to put it through its paces in my lab.

&nbsp;

*   Over at ElasticSkies there is <a href="http://elasticskies.com/vcac-6-0-ga/" target="_blank">a good blog post on the new releaseÂ detailing the new features</a>. I was surprised by the number of hypervisors supported by vCAC 6.0, I wonder how many people really run multi-hypervisor environments?

&nbsp;

*   Tom Fojta has a very useful blog post on <a href="http://fojta.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/vcac-6-how-to-generate-signed-certificates/" target="_blank">how to generate and replace the self signed certificates</a>. Replacing certificates always seems to be a pain but this looks pretty easy. I know VMware have been putting a lot of effort into making certificate replacement much easier.

&nbsp;

*   To help out with the Windows install side, VMware have released <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/12/vmware-vcloud-automation-center-6-pre-req-automation-script.html" target="_blank">a PowerShell prerequisite checking script</a>. This should come in handy, I wish more vendors would do this!

&nbsp;

*   For those of you with existing vCAC deployments be warned that there is currently no migration path. VMware have released <a href="http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2065819" target="_blank">a KB advising there is an automated migration path in the works for some time 2014</a>. A bit of a bummer!
