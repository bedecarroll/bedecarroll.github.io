*   One to look out for those of you with IIS based websites, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2684600" target="_blank">Update decreases the page load time of web sites that are hosted on Windows 7-based and Windows Server 2008 R2-based web servers</a>.

&nbsp;

*   I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all see the trust relationship error with Windows computers however KB 2914472 details that <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2914472" target="_blank">this can be caused by an IIS issue</a>. A hotfix is referenced.

&nbsp;

*   For you Hyper-V and SCOM users (though I suppose if you use Hyper-V you have to use SCOM) there is <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askcore/archive/2013/12/10/hyper-v-management-pack-extensions-2012-2012r2-available.aspx" target="_blank">a new version of the Hyper-V Management Pack Extensions for R2</a>.

&nbsp;

*   I&#8217;m a bit late to posting this but over at Daniel&#8217;s Tech Blog there is <a href="http://www.danielstechblog.de/system-center-2012-r2-release-notes/" target="_blank">a post with links to all the System Center 2012 R2 release notes</a>. The blog is in German but the names and links are in English.

&nbsp;

*   Another one I&#8217;m just getting a chance to talk about, Alessandro Cardoso over at Virtualisation & Management Blog has <a href="http://cloudtidings.com/2013/10/19/windows-server-2012-r2-key-capabilities/" target="_blank">a post detailing the important new features of Server 2012 R2</a>. When Microsoft update the MCSA/MCSE exams (January 1st apparently) this post will come in quite handy I&#8217;m guessing.
