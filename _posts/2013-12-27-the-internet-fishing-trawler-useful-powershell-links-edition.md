*   Jeff Wouters has <a href="http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2013/11/powershell-function-to-find-groups-with-not-users-as-members/" target="_blank">a handy script to find empty Active Directory groups</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Another good one from Jeff Wouters, this time <a href="http://jeffwouters.nl/index.php/2013/11/powershell-function-to-list-users-in-authorative-groups-in-active-directory/" target="_blank">to find the users in the &#8220;authoritative groups&#8221;</a>. I believe the authoritative groups Jeff is referencing are the BUILTIN groups.

*   If you are looking to play tricks on your coworkers or have a legitimate reason to eject the CD-ROM drive, <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/11/12/pstip-ejecting-and-closing-cdrom-drive-the-powershell-way/" target="_blank">PowerShell Magazine have you covered</a>.

&nbsp;

*   Jeffery Hicks at The Lonely Administrator has posted <a href="http://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/2013/11/powershell-clean-up-tools/" target="_blank">the PowerShell scripts he uses to clean out his TEMP files</a>. I&#8217;m a big believer in reading scripts to keep your language skills sharp so even if you have no need for the functions it is a worthwhile read.

&nbsp;

*   This is more of a fun/aesthetic one from Jeffery Hicks, &#8220;<a href="http://jdhitsolutions.com/blog/2013/11/friday-fun-theme-me-up/" target="_blank">Friday Fun: Theme Me Up!</a>&#8220;. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to make some changes to the look of ISE, Jeffery will show you how. I always recommend doing some theming work, it teaches you a lot about a language and the execution environment.
