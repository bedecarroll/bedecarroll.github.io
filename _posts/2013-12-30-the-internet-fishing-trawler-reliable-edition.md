*   With all the brouhaha about VSAN (and I admit I&#8217;m looking very hard at it and how much it would cost to get a nice home lab setup) the requirement for one SSD per disk group should show the importance of SSD reliability. If you plan on using consumer grade SSDs or SSDs not from your hardware OEM (and even then) you are going to want to test them, hard. With that I would really recommend reading the &#8220;<a href="http://lkcl.net/reports/ssd_analysis.html" target="_blank">Analysis of SSD Reliability during power-outages</a>&#8221; report. I hope more tests like these are performed.

*   Over at Jay Roxe&#8217;s Blog at Rapid7 there is <a href="https://community.rapid7.com/people/jroxe/blog/2013/12/21/learning-from-targets-breach" target="_blank">a post on the Target security breach with some good links</a>. I wonder what changes will finally start happening when the financial cost of all these losses becomes to high.

*   Brian Berry over at devopsanywhere has <a href="http://devopsanywhere.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/why-im-learning-java.html" target="_blank">a post on why he is learning Java</a>. While I think we all have an opinion on what language to learn, posts like these help to decide out of the thousands of languages out there.

*   Damian Flynn over at Petri has an article discussing <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/distribute-cumulative-update-3-system-center-configuration-manager-sccm-2012-sp1.htm" target="_blank">how to distribute CU3 for SCCM 2012 SP1</a>.

*   Seems there is a bug with the Virtual Fibre Channel controller in Hyper-V 2012,Â <a href="http://www.hyper-v.nu/archives/hvredevoort/2013/11/hotfix-vm-virtual-fibre-channel-loses-access-to-lun-after-live-migration" target="_blank">Hans Vredevoort at Hyper-V.NU has the details</a>. A virtual FC HBA seems a bit odd to me but I&#8217;m guessing it is one of those features that if you are using it, it would be for a specific requirement.
