*   Chris M Evans over at ArchitectingIT has a good post on <a href="http://architecting.it/2013/12/20/a-ten-year-flash-array-no-thanks/" target="_blank">why he doesn&#8217;t want to see a ten year old flash array</a>. I honestly don&#8217;t think to many organisations really keep ancient arrays around as their primary storage array, the support costs alone would be astronomical.

&nbsp;

*   Speaking of flash, the VMware vSphere blog has a useful post on <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2013/12/virtual-san-hardware-guidance-part-1-solid-state-drives.html" target="_blank">VSAN hardware guidance with SSDs</a>. I&#8217;ve linked to the first part in the series. I think I&#8217;ll be holding off till the next generation of servers come out, sometime this year (2014).

*   Over at Hostile Coding there is a blog post on <a href="http://hostilecoding.blogspot.com.au/2013/12/vmware-shrink-vmdks-by-removing-zeroed.html" target="_blank">how to shrink VMDKs that you will want to add to your notes</a>. This is how to perform a space reclamation of zeroed space, not how to physically reduce the size of the VMDK.

*   If you jump through some hoops you can <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2916984" target="_blank">get Windows Server 2012 to blue screen when removing and adding an SSD</a>. I doubt many people are going to trip this one but I found the &#8220;status&#8221; to be a bit funny, it basically says Microsoft could fix it with some random update in the future. Lucky it isn&#8217;t a bigger issue!

*   If you are looking hard at PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) you are going to want to look at <a href="http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2013/12/27/desired-state-configuration-dsc-resource-kit-wave-1/" target="_blank">the recently released DSC Resource Kit that PowerShell Magazine has an article on</a>.
